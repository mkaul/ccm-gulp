# ccm-gulp
gulp scripts for ccm components management. gulp writes minified files to the dist directory and adapts all server URLs accordingly. JSON files are transformed into JSONP files for cross domain access. For more details see gulpfile.js. 

For getting started with gulp see [gulp getting-started](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)
